#### Can I access a cluster from within {{ yandex-cloud }}? {#conn-from-yc}

You can connect to {{ mpg-short-name }} cluster hosts:
* Over the internet, if you configured public access for the appropriate host. You can only connect to such hosts over an SSL connection.
* From {{ yandex-cloud }} virtual machines located in the same cloud network. If the host is not publicly accessible, there is no need to use SSL for connections from such virtual machines.
* From a container in [{{ serverless-containers-full-name }}](../../serverless-containers/concepts/index.md). If the host is not publicly accessible, the container must be located in the same cloud network.

For more information, see the [service documentation](../../managed-postgresql/operations/connect.md).

#### Can I connect to a cluster from a Docker container? {#conn-from-docker}

Yes, you can. To do this, [configure the Dockerfile](../../managed-postgresql/operations/connect.md#connection-docker).

You can find an example of connection from a container in {{ serverless-containers-full-name }} in [this tutorial](../../serverless-containers/tutorials/pg-connect.md).

#### How do I obtain an SSL certificate to connect to {{ mpg-name }} on Windows? {#get-ssl}

You can obtain an SSL certificate using PowerShell:

```powershell
mkdir $HOME\.postgresql; curl.exe --output $HOME\.postgresql\root.crt {{ crt-web-path }}
```

The certificate will be saved to the `$HOME\.postgresql\root.crt` file.

For more information about obtaining a certificate and connecting to a database, see the [service documentation](../../managed-postgresql/operations/connect.md).

#### How do I install an SSL certificate to connect Power BI to {{ mpg-name }} via psql? {#power-bi}

1. Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux]({{ ms.docs }}/windows/wsl/) (WSL) and run the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   mkdir /mnt/c/temp && \
   curl "{{ crt-web-path }}" --output /mnt/c/temp/CA.pem && \
   openssl pkcs12 -export -out /mnt/c/temp/CA.pfx -nokeys -in /mnt/c/temp/CA.pem
   ```

   The certificate will be available at `C:\temp\CA.pfx`.

1. [Place the obtained certificate in the Windows certificate store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skype-sdk/sdn/articles/installing-the-trusted-root-certificate).

#### Can I connect to cluster hosts over SSH? {#connect-ssh}

{% include [connect-via-ssh](../../_includes/mdb/connect-via-ssh.md) %}

#### What is the maximum allowed number of concurrent connections to a single host in {{ mpg-name }}? {#host-conn}

The number of concurrent connections is specified at the cluster level in the [**Max connections** setting](../../managed-postgresql/concepts/settings-list.md#setting-max-connections). By default, the maximum value is set, which is calculated by the following formula:

```text
200 Ã— <number_of_vCPUs_per_host>
```

For information about how to update the {{ PG }} settings at the cluster level, see our [documentation](../../managed-postgresql/operations/update.md#change-postgresql-config).

#### What is the allowed number of connections per user? {#user-conn}

By default, a cluster reserves 50 connections to each host per user. You can change this number in the [**Conn limit** setting](../../managed-postgresql/concepts/settings-list.md#setting-conn-limit).

If the connection limit per user is reached, any attempt to establish a new connection will fail with the following error:

```text
too many active clients for user (pool_size for user <user_name> reached <limit_value>)
```

To learn how to update {{ PG }} settings at the user level, see [this tutorial](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-users.md#update-settings).

#### Why do I get an error when trying to connect to a database from {{ google-looker }}? {#google-looker}

To connect from {{ google-looker }}, be sure to generate a client certificate file and a private key and specify them in the connection settings. For more information about how to do this, see [Connecting from {{ google-looker }}](../../managed-postgresql/operations/connect.md#connection-google-looker).
