#### Why do I get an error when using the TimescaleDB extension? {#timescale}

Error message:

```text
SQL Error [0A000]: ERROR: functionality not supported under the current "apache" license
Hint: Upgrade your license to 'timescale' to use this free community feature.
```

This error occurs when you attempt to use a function available only in TimescaleDB Community Edition.

The community edition is distributed under the [Timescale license (TSL)](https://www.timescale.com/legal/licenses). Clause 2.2 of the license prohibits using TimescaleDB Community Edition to provide DbaaS (Database as a Service) services, so this version is not available in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

The version installed in a {{ mpg-name }} cluster is TimescaleDB Apache 2 Edition, and its features are limited compared to the community version.

#### What should I do if I get the revocation check error when using PowerShell to obtain an SSL certificate? {#get-ssl-error}

Here is the full text of the error:

```text
curl: (35) schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: Unknown error (0x80092012)
The revocation function was unable to check revocation for the certificate
```

This means, when connecting to the website, the service was unable to check whether or not its certificate was listed among revoked ones.

To fix this error:

* Make sure the corporate network settings do not block the check.
* Run the command with the `--ssl-no-revoke` parameter.

    ```powershell
    mkdir $HOME\.postgresql; curl.exe --ssl-no-revoke -o $HOME\.postgresql\root.crt {{ crt-web-path }}
    ```

#### What should I do if I get the `SSL is required` error when connecting? {#ssl-req}

The error occurs because you are trying to connect to the cluster with a [public host](../../managed-postgresql/concepts/network.md#public-access-to-a-host). These hosts only support connections with an SSL certificate. You can:

* [Obtain an SSL certificate](../../managed-postgresql/operations/connect.md#get-ssl-cert) and add it to the application you are using to connect to the cluster.
* [Disable public access to hosts](../../managed-postgresql/operations/hosts.md#update) and connect to the cluster from a VM located in the same cloud network.

#### What should I do if I get the `too many active clients for user` error when connecting? {#connection-limit-error}

Connecting to cluster hosts may fail with the following error:

```text
too many active clients for user (pool_size for user <user_name> reached <limit_value>)
```

By default, a cluster reserves 50 connections to each host per user. If the connection limit per user is reached, any attempt to establish a new connection will fail with an error.

Solution: Increase the connection limit in the [**Conn limit** setting](../../managed-postgresql/concepts/settings-list.md#setting-conn-limit).

To learn how to update {{ PG }} settings at the user level, see [this tutorial](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-users.md#update-settings).

#### Why do I get an error when trying to connect to a database? {#database-error}

Connecting to a database may fail with an error like:

```text
ERROR: odyssey: ce3ea075f4ffa: route for 'dbname.username' is not found
```

The error means that the connection parameters contain an invalid database name.

#### Why does a connection terminate with an error? {#connection-error}

A {{ mpg-name }} cluster connection may be terminated with the following message:

```text
FATAL: terminating connection due to administrator command
```

This message does not indicate an error, it means that the session/transaction duration has exceeded the [Session duration timeout](../../managed-postgresql/concepts/settings-list.md#setting-session-duration-timeout) setting value (default value: 12 hours).

#### Why cannot I connect to cluster hosts? {#host-error}

Connecting to cluster hosts may fail with the following error:

```text
could not translate host name "<regular or special FQDN>" to address: Name or service not known
```

This error occurs if public access to the host is denied or users are using custom DNS servers that do not allow domain names in the `mdb.yandexcloud.net` zone.

Solution:

* Enable public access for the host you are connecting to. When using a [special FQDN](../../managed-postgresql/operations/connect.md#special-fqdns), enable public access for the host the special FQDN points to.
* We recommend that you enable public access for all cluster hosts. This will avoid connection errors during automatic master failover.
* For custom DNS servers, configure DNS forwarding for the `mdb.yandexcloud.net` zone.

#### Why cannot I stop a cluster? {#stop-cluster}

Error message:

```text
ERROR: rpc error: code = FailedPrecondition desc = Cluster has no backups
```

A cluster that has no backups cannot be [stopped](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-stop.md#stop-cluster). To fix the error and stop the cluster, [create its backup](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-backups.md#create-backup).

#### Why do I get the `max_connections is less than sum of users connection limit` error when modifying a cluster? {#max-connections-error}

This error may occur when downgrading a host class in a cluster if the sum of connection limits for all users is less then the total cluster connection limit ([Max connections](../../managed-postgresql/concepts/settings-list.md#setting-max-connections)).

Solution: First reduce the limits set for users so their sum is less than `<Max_connections_value> â€” 15` and then proceed with host class downgrade.

#### Why does a data transfer through creating and restoring a logical dump fail with an error? {#backup-error}

[Restoring a logical dump](../../managed-postgresql/tutorials/data-migration.md#backup) may fail with one of the following errors:

* `ERROR:  role "<source_username>" does not exist`
* `ERROR:  must be member of role "<source_username>"`

The errors occur because the target cluster does not have the user (or the privileges of the user) who created the logical dump in the source cluster.

To resolve the errors:

1. In the target cluster, [add a user](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-users.md#adduser) with access to the migrated database and the same name as the user who created the logical dump in the source cluster.
1. Use this user to [restore the logical dump](../../managed-postgresql/tutorials/data-migration.md#restore) or [grant their privileges](../../managed-postgresql/operations/grant.md#grant-privilege) to the user who is restoring the logical dump.

#### What should I do if I get the `replication slot already exists` error when performing logical replication? {#repl-slot-exists}

By default, when you [create a subscription](../../tutorials/dataplatform/postgresql-data-migration.md#create-publication-subscription), a replication slot is also created. The `replication slot already exists` error means that a replication slot already exists.

You can fix this error by doing one of the following:

1. Link your subscription to an existing replication slot. To do this, add the `create_slot = false` parameter to the request to create a subscription.
1. [Delete the existing replication slot](../../managed-postgresql/operations/replication-slots.md#delete) and try creating the subscription again.

#### Why do I get an `extension... is not available` error when migrating my DB to {{ mpg-short-name }}? {#extension-is-not-available}

Error message:

```text
extension "<extension_name>" is not available
```

You may get this error when migrating a DB to {{ mpg-short-name }} with a script attempting to install and use the [{{ PG }} extension](../../managed-postgresql/operations/extensions/cluster-extensions.md). The reason for the error is that in {{ mpg-short-name }} clusters, you cannot use SQL commands to manage {{ PG }} extensions.

To avoid this error:

1. If the script or logical dump is in text format, remove the operators for creating {{ PG }} extensions from them.
1. [Install](../../managed-postgresql/operations/extensions/cluster-extensions.md#update-extensions) all required extensions in the target database using the {{ yandex-cloud }} interfaces.
