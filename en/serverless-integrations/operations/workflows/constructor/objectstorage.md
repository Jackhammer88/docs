  1. {% include [integrations-step1](../../../../_includes/serverless-integrations/workflows-constructor/integrations-step1.md) %} 
  1. From the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.serverless-workflows.workflow-editor_integration-group-label }}** section on the left side of the screen, drag the ![object-storage-icon](../../../../_assets/object-storage-icon.svg) **{{ objstorage-name }}** element to the appropriate workflow location in the constructor window.

      {% include [step-drag-destination-desc](../../../../_includes/serverless-integrations/workflows-constructor/step-drag-destination-desc.md) %}
  1. In the workflow schema window, click the added **{{ objstorage-name }}** section to select it.
  1. {% include [integrations-step-select-settings-tab](../../../../_includes/serverless-integrations/workflows-constructor/integrations-step-select-settings-tab.md) %}

      1. {% include [integrations-name-the-step](../../../../_includes/serverless-integrations/workflows-constructor/integrations-name-the-step.md) %}
      1. In the **Bucket** field, select the [bucket](../../../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) with objects to interact with as part of your workflow.
      1. In the **Object name** field, specify the name of the [object](../../../../storage/concepts/object.md) you are going to interact with.
      1. In the **Action** field, select:

          * `Add object` to add a new object to the bucket.
          * `Get object` to get an objectâ€™s content from the bucket.

      1. In the **Content type** field, select the content type of the target object:

          {% cut "If you are adding an object to the bucket" %}

          * `BINARY`: Object content will be decoded from [Base64](https://{{ lang }}.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) format.
          * `TEXT`: Object content will be saved in plain text format.
          * `JSON`: Object text containing JSON will be saved as a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) structure.

          {% endcut %}

          {% cut "If you are getting an object from the bucket" %}

          * `BINARY`: Object content will be encoded in [Base64](https://{{ lang }}.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) format.
          * `JSON`: Object content will be received as a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) structure.
          * `TEXT`: Object content will be received in plain text format.
          * `EXCEL`: Object content will be converted into an array of pages, where each page is an array of string arrays. Supported formats: `XLAM`, `XLSM`, `XLSX`, `XLTM`, and `XLTX`.
          * `CSV`: Object content will be converted into an array of string arrays by dividing the strings based on the following separators: comma (`,`) and line break.

          {% endcut %}

      1. If you are adding an object to the bucket, specify the content of the new object in the **Object content** field.
      1. {% include [integrations-step-timeout](../../../../_includes/serverless-integrations/workflows-constructor/integrations-step-timeout.md) %}
      1. {% include [integrations-step-retry-policy](../../../../_includes/serverless-integrations/workflows-constructor/integrations-step-retry-policy.md) %}
