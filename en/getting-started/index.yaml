    When creating their first billing account, new Yandex Cloud customers
    receive the <a href="usage-grant">initial grant</a>, which expires in 60
    days. The grant terms of use are different for individual and business
    accounts.
  - >-
    In addition, new customers who are legal entities can make use of a trial
    period. The trial period allows you to get hands-on experience with Yandex
    Cloud by using the initial grant to pay for the resources you consume. You
    can upgrade to the paid version at any time during the trial period or 60
    days after it expires, without losing any data.
