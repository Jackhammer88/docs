# Initial grant for individual and business accounts

The initial grant can be issued to an individual or legal entity owned by the same individual only once. For example, if the grant is already issued to an individual, it will not be issued to their legal entity. You get your initial grant when [creating your first billing account](../billing/quickstart/index.md) provided that you:

* Never purchased {{ yandex-cloud }} services before.
* Have not activated the [trial period](../billing/concepts/trial-period.md).


The initial grant terms of use are different for individual and business accounts.

Learn more about grants in the [{{ billing-name }}](../billing/concepts/bonus-account.md) documentation.


## Business account {#business}

Grant terms of use depend on:
* Your country of residence.
* The payment method you select when registering and [creating your billing account](../billing/quickstart/index.md).
