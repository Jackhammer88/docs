The `storage.editor` role enables you to perform any operation with [buckets](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) and [objects](../../storage/concepts/object.md) in the folder: create, delete, and edit them.

This role does not allow you to manage [access control list](../../storage/concepts/acl.md) (ACL) settings or create publicly accessible buckets.
