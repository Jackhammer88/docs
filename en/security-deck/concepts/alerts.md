# About {{ alerts-name }}

{% include [preview-by-request](../../_includes/note-preview-by-request.md) %}

{{ sd-full-name }}'s {{ alerts-name }} module provides a single interface for information on security issues. Issues may include attacks on infrastructure, vulnerabilities, insecure configurations, leaks, and incidents. {{ alerts-name }} draws data from other security services, such as [{{ dspm-name }}](dspm.md).

This module provides additional information about each alert, a list of affected resources, the source of the alert, and tips on how to resolve the issue.
