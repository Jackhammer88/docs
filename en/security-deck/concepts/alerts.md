# {{ alerts-name }} module

{% include [preview-by-request](../../_includes/note-preview-by-request.md) %}

The {{alerts-name}} module in {{sd-full-name}} allows you to view information about security issues in a single interface. Issues can include attacks on infrastructure, vulnerabilities, insecure configurations, leaks, and incidents. The {{alerts-name}} module uses other cloud security services as data sources, such as [{{dspm-name}}](dspm.md).

The module provides additional information about each alert, a list of affected resources, the source of the alert, and recommendations for troubleshooting the problem.
