# Event search in audit logs

This tutorial provides popular [requests, filters, and commands](examples.md) that allow you to retrieve the events you need from the audit logs of {{ yandex-cloud }} resources using the following [tools](tools.md):

* {{ yq-full-name }}
* {{ cloud-logging-full-name }}
* jq

You can check how searching for events in audit logs works using an [example](query.md) where a {{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket with audit logs is connected to {{ yq-name }}.
