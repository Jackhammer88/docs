# Removing a user from a project

To remove a user from a project, you need the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` role for this project or the space the project belongs to. Once removed, the user will not be able to access the project.

To remove a user from a project:

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space you need and select a project.
1. Navigate to the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.team.team }}** tab.
1. In the user's line, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) → ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/trash-bin.svg) **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.common.delete-key-value }}**.
1. Confirm user deletion.
