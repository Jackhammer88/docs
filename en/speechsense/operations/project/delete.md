# Deleting a project

To delete a project, you need the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` role for either the space or the project you want to delete.

To delete a project:

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space you need and select a project.
1. In the top-right corner, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.common.more }}** → ![delete](../../../_assets/console-icons/trash-bin.svg) **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.common.delete-key-value }}**.
1. Confirm project deletion.

{% note warning %}

You can restore a deleted project within 7 days by contacting [support]({{ link-console-support }}). During this period, you will not be able to create a new project with the same name.
