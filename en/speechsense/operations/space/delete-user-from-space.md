# Removing a user from a space

To remove users from a space, you need the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` role for the space. Once removed, they will not be able to access the space as well as the connections and projects within it.

To remove a user from a space:

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space of interest and select the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.team.team }}** tab.
1. In the user's line, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) → ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/trash-bin.svg) **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.common.delete-key-value }}**.
1. Confirm user deletion.
