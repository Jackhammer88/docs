# Changing quotas

Potentially, you can change your quotas ​​up to the limit values, i.e., the cloud platform's ceiling.

{% include [request-quota](../../_includes/quota-manager/request-quota.md) %}

You can view the default quotas in the relevant documentation:

* On the general [quota page](../../overview/concepts/quotas-limits.md#quotas-limits-default).
* On the **Concepts > Quotas and Limits** page for each service.

There is no reset to default values in {{ quota-manager-name }}.
