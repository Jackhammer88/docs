# {{ data-transfer-name }} release notes: June 2025


1. You can now export data from the [{{ metrika }} source](../operations/endpoint/source/metrika.md) for a specified period.


1. Added dynamic tooltips in the transfer configuration interface.

1. Added a [setting](../operations/endpoint/target/clickhouse.md#additional-settings) to ignore changes to the target data schema when the source schema is modified. By default, when the source schema is modified, the transfer will update the target schema accordingly: create new tables, add new columns, add new enumerated values and enumerated types.

1. Added a [setting](../operations/endpoint/source/greenplum.md#additional-settings) to disable the `gpfdist` [utility](../../managed-greenplum/operations/gpfdist/connect.md) for transfers from {{ GP }} to {{ GP }}.
