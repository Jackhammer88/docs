# {{ data-transfer-name }} release notes: April 2025

## Fixed issues and improvements {#problems-solved}

1. Improved transfers between sources with very large numbers of objects ([{{ objstorage-short-name }}](../operations/endpoint/source/object-storage.md) or [{{ CH }}](../operations/endpoint/source/clickhouse.md)).
1. Fixed the connection leak to the [{{ CH }}](../operations/endpoint/target/clickhouse.md) target.
1. Fixed an issue with data transfers from [{{ PG }}](../operations/endpoint/source/postgresql.md) sources: types in schemas other than `public` could not be transferred if such schemas were specified in `search_path`.
1. Increased stability of [{{ CH }}](../operations/endpoint/target/clickhouse.md) transfers under various target cluster faults.
1. Improved validation in the {{ PG }} endpoint creation form.
1. Fixed the issue of changing the connection type in the [{{ PG }}](../operations/endpoint/source/postgresql.md) source: when the type was changed from custom installation to managed database cluster installation, the transfer would keep attempting to connect to the custom installation host.
