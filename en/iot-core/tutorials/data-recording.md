# Writing data from a device into a database

In this tutorial, you will write data from a device into a database. The example uses a [{{ mpg-full-name }} cluster](../../managed-postgresql/concepts/index.md). To connect your device to {{ iot-name }}, you will need an MQTT broker. You will perform all the steps in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
