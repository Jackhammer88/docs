# Supported languages and recognition models


A recognition model is a model trained to recognize speech in a particular language. The models are trained on datasets generated by Yandex services and applications. This allows us to continually improve speech recognition quality. 

The main supported model for each recognition type is the `general` model. It recognizes speech on any topic in a given language, including short and long utterances, names, addresses, dates, and numbers.


## Version tags {#tags}

Three versions of the `general` model can be available at the same time. You can select the one you need by tags:

* `general`: The main version of the model.
* `general:rc`: The release candidate version available for testing.
* `general:deprecated`: The previous version of the model.

{% note info %}

We stop supporting the `general:deprecated` tag versions as new models are released: {{ speechkit-name }} guarantees two weeks of support for the previous version after we update the `general` tag version. You can find the list of updates in [{#T}](../release-notes-stt.md).

{% endnote %}

You can also use the `deferred-general` tag for asynchronous recognition with the [API v2](api/transcribation-api.md). [Learn more about asynchronous recognition modes](transcribation.md#modes).
