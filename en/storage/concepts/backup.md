# Object backups

{{ objstorage-name }} allows you to securely store your uploaded objects in a replicated storage; however, it does not provide any dedicated backup tools.

To back up your objects, you can regularly download them from {{ objstorage-name }} and store them in your own infrastructure or in another cloud storage.

To automate backups, use the [supported tools](../tools/index.md).
