After Joomla installation is complete, enter your websiteâ€™s IP address or domain name in the browser to test the site:

* `http://<VM_public_IP_address>`
* `http://example.com`
* `https://example.com`

Now you can further configure your website and add content using the Joomla admin interface and tools.
