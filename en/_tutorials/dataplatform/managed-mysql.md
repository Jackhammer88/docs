# Migrating {{ MY }} clusters

With {{ data-transfer-name }}, you can transfer data from a third-party source cluster to a {{ mmy-name }} target cluster.

This method allows you to migrate the entire database without interrupting user service. To use it, allow connections to the source cluster from the internet.
