# Video API, REST: Stream.BatchGet

Retrieves multiple streams by their IDs in a specific channel in a single request.
This is more efficient than making multiple Get requests when retrieving several streams.

## HTTP request

```
POST https://video.{{ api-host }}/video/v1/streams:batchGet
```

## Body parameters {#yandex.cloud.video.v1.BatchGetStreamsRequest}

```json

  "channelId": "string",
  "streamIds": [
    "string"
  ]
}
```

#|
||Field | Description ||
