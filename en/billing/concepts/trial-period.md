# Trial period for new customers

{% include [free-trial-conditions](../../_includes/free-trial-conditions.md) %}

You can enable the trial period only when [creating your first billing account](../quickstart/index.md) for a legal entity in {{ billing-name }}.

During the trial period, you can use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources for free with some limitations. Resource usage costs are charged against your [initial grant](bonus-account.md#start). After the end of the trial period, the resources will be retained but discontinued. Your trial period will end automatically depending on the payment method you selected when [creating your billing account for businesses](../quickstart/index.md). For more information, see [{#T}](../../getting-started/free-trial/concepts/trial-ending.md).

To restore full access to {{ yandex-cloud }} after your trial period ends, you will need to upgrade to the paid version.

You can check your remaining initial grant amount and trial days on the [**{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.navigation-menu.label_billing }}**]({{ link-console-billing }}) page in your billing account. During the trial period, you can also [view statistics](../operations/check-charges.md) on resource usage and charges based on the usage rate.
