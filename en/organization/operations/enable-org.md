# Creating an organization

[_Organization_](../../overview/roles-and-resources.md) is a workspace that combines different types of {{ yandex-cloud }} resources and users. To enable your employees to use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, create an organization and add them to it. Any Yandex user can create an organization in {{ org-full-name }}.

Before you start using {{ org-full-name }}, [log in]({{ link-passport-login }}) to your Yandex account. If you do not have an account, [create]({{ support-passport-create }}) one.

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- {{ cloud-center }} interface {#cloud-center}

  {% include [create-new-org](../../_includes/organization/create-new-org.md) %}

{% endlist %}

After registering, you become the organization owner and can manage its settings.

To get started:

- [Add](./add-account.md) users with Yandex accounts to the organization.
- [Configure an identity federation](../concepts/add-federation.md), so that your employees can log in to the organization using their work accounts.
