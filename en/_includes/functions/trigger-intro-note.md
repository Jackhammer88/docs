Each trigger type has its own conditions. For example, a trigger for {{ objstorage-name }} may fire when an object is [created](../../storage/operations/objects/upload.md) or [updated](../../storage/operations/objects/edit-acl.md). You can set some conditions in the service object settings, e.g., notification thresholds in the [budget](../../billing/concepts/budget.md) settings would act as trigger conditions for budgets.
