{% note warning %}

In a SAML app, only one certificate can be active. Activating a new certificate automatically deactivates the current one. After you activate the new certificate, do not forget to [upload](../../organization/operations/applications/saml-create.md#setup-sp) it to the app's integration settings on the service providerâ€™s side.
