The name must be unique throughout {{ cns-short-name }}. Once the channel is created, you will not be able to change the name. The name may contain lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods. It must be from 1 to 256 characters long. For APNs channels, we recommend specifying the bundle ID in the name; for FCM and HMS, the full package name; for RuStore, `packageName`.
