ARL (Advanced Rate Limiter) is a module used to monitor and limit web application loads. It allows you to set a limit on the number of HTTP requests over a certain period of time. All requests above the limit will be blocked. You can set a single limit for all traffic or configure different limits to segment requests by certain parameters. For the purpose of limits, you can count requests one by one or group them together based on specified property.
