To work with the proxy server, a service account with the `monitoring.editor`, `smart-web-security.admin`, `certificate-manager.admin`, `logging.writer` roles will be created.
        
Creating a proxy server can take several minutes. Wait for the server to get the `Active` status. After that, you can add a domain.
