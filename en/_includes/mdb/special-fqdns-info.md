In multiple-host clusters, special FQDNs may for some time (up to 10 minutes) point to the old host, even if it has changed its role (e.g., from a master to a replica). If using a special FQDN which points to the current master, some write requests may fail if routed to the replica. This is because it takes time to update DNS records for special FQDNs. If your write request returns an error, repeat it later.
