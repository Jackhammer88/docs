`admin` is a dedicated user required to manage the cluster and cannot be deleted. Such a user has the `superuser` role and can perform any operations with the cluster.

{% note tip %}

This user is not intended for routine jobs; for those, we recommend creating regular users. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../managed-opensearch/operations/cluster-users.md).
