{% note info %}

Up to 5% of disk space is reserved for system use, so the disks may have less available space than indicated when creating a cluster.

For more information about sizes and performance of different disk types, see the [{{ compute-full-name }} documentation](../../compute/concepts/limits.md#compute-limits-disks).
