If the CDN provider is not activated yet, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.cdn.label_activate-provider-empty-container_action-text }}**. CDN will be enabled automatically.

If you do not see the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.cdn.label_activate-provider-empty-container_action-text }}** button but you can create resources and origin groups, it means the provider is already activated. Proceed to the next step.
