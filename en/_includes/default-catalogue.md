By default, the CLI uses the folder specified when [creating](../cli/operations/profile/profile-create.md) the profile. To change the default folder, use the `yc config set folder-id <folder_ID>` command. You can also set a different folder for any specific command using the `--folder-name` or `--folder-id` parameter.
