### Server-side copy {#server-side-copy}

[Server-side copy](../../storage/operations/objects/copy.md) features in buckets with access restricted to {{ vpc-short-name }} service connections:
* If both the source and target buckets are configured to be accessed only from {{ vpc-short-name }} service connections, server-side copy can only be initiated by a request from a service connection listed among the allowed ones for both buckets, and only if the client has read permissions for the source bucket and write permissions for the target bucket. If the request does not come from a service connection, it will not be executed.
* If the source bucket is configured to be accessed only from {{ vpc-short-name }} service connections, while the target bucket is accessible from the public network, server-side copy can only be initiated by a request from a service connection listed among the allowed ones for the source bucket, and only if the client has read permissions for the source bucket and write permissions for the target bucket.
