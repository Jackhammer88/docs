You can apply a [predefined ACL](../../storage/concepts/acl.md#predefined-acls) to an object or configure permissions for individual users, [service accounts](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [user groups](../../organization/concepts/groups.md), and [public groups](../../storage/concepts/acl.md#public-groups) (all internet users, all authenticated {{ yandex-cloud }} users). These settings cannot be used together: an object can have either a predefined ACL or individual permissions.
