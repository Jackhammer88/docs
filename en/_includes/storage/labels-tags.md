{% note info %}

{{ yandex-cloud }} uses _labels_ to logically identify resources. However, {{ objstorage-name }} supports compatibility with [Amazon S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html), that is why we use _tags_, a term native to AWS, in the [AWS CLI](../../storage/tools/aws-cli.md) commands and [API](../../storage/s3/) parameters.
