If you want to configure an access policy for a bucket and connect to it from a {{ metastore-full-name }} or {{ maf-full-name }} cluster, you will need some additional infrastructure setup. For more information, see these guides for [{{ metastore-name }}](../../metadata-hub/operations/metastore/s3-policy-connect.md) and [{{ maf-name }}](../../managed-airflow/operations/s3-policy-connect.md).
