For your convenience with the plugin, there are _quick actions_, i.e., {{ ca-name }} integrations with your IDE.

The following integrations are available for Visual Studio Code:
* _Lightbulb_: Menu you access by clicking ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/bulb.svg) next to the code blocks and can use to generate [docs](../../code-assistant/operations/quick-actions.md#docs) and [tests](../../code-assistant/operations/quick-actions.md#test).
* _CodeLens_: Buttons above the code blocks you can use to generate docs and tests and [set up actions displayed in codelenses and lightbulbs](../../code-assistant/operations/quick-actions.md#set-actions).
* _Context menu_: Right-click menu you can use to generate docs and tests, [send selected code to the chat](../../code-assistant/operations/quick-actions.md#send-to-chat), request code [autocompletion](../../code-assistant/operations/quick-actions.md#autocompletion)/[improvements](../../code-assistant/operations/quick-actions.md#provide-improvements), or [generate a commit message](../../code-assistant/operations/quick-actions.md#commit) in the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system.

For JetBrains IDEs, there are codelenses that can generate docs and tests.
