This method provides access to all metadata [folders](../../../compute/concepts/metadata/directories.md) as well as some keys in them: 

* In the [computeMetadata folder](../../../compute/concepts/metadata/directories.md#dir-compute), only the keys in `/instance/attributes/*` are readable.
* The [user-data folder](../../../compute/concepts/metadata/directories.md#dir-user) is fully readable.
