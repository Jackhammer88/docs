If an [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) is under maintenance or has technical problems, you can configure {{ yandex-cloud }} to automatically prohibit your load balancer from sending traffic to that zone. This will ensure your services stay operational. Once the zone is recovered, traffic will once again be routed to all the zones configured for the load balancer.
