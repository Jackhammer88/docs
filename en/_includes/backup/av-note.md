{% note info %}

If you use a policy with the `fastBackupEnabled` [option](../../backup/concepts/policy.md#specification) and ran an antivirus scan before creating an [incremental backup](../../backup/concepts/backup.md#types), the backup time may increase significantly. For more information, see [{#T}](../../backup/concepts/av-interaction.md).
