For faster data [backup](../../../backup/operations/backup-vm/create.md) and [recovery](../../../backup/operations/backup-vm/recover.md), the [{{ backup-name }} agent](../../../backup/concepts/agent.md) can consume significant amounts of RAM of the backed up resource, i.e., [virtual machine](../../../compute/concepts/vm.md) or [{{ baremetal-name }} server](../../../baremetal/concepts/servers.md). The agent can even use up all the available RAM, which in some cases may disrupt the resource's other services and make it impossible to complete the backup or recovery process.
