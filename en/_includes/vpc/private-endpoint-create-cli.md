1. View the description of the CLI command to create a service connection:

    ```bash
    yc vpc private-endpoint create --help
    ```

1. Create a service connection to {{ objstorage-short-name }} in the default folder:

    ```bash
    yc vpc private-endpoint create \
      --name <service_connection_name> \
      --description "<service_connection_description>" \
      --network-name <network_name> \
      --object-storage 
    ```

    Where:

    * `--name`: (Optional) Service connection name.
    * `--description`: (Optional) Service connection description.
    * `--network-name`: Name of the [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) the service connection will be created in. You can also use the [network ID](../../vpc/operations/network-get-info.md) in the `--network-id` parameter.
    * `--object-storage`: Service connection to {{ objstorage-short-name }}. Other service connection types are not available yet.

    When creating a service connection, you can use the following additional parameters:

    * `--address-spec`: (Optional) Parameters in the `key=value` format for the internal IP address which will be assigned to the service connection:
      * `address`: (Optional) Private IP address for the service connection. If no IP address is provided, a random one will be assigned from the specified subnetâ€™s range.
      * `subnet-id`: (Optional) [ID of the subnet](../../vpc/operations/subnet-get-info.md) to provide an IP address for the service connection. If no subnet ID is provided, a random internal IP address will be assigned from the range of one of the subnets in the cloud network.

        {% note info %}

        To create a service connection, you should have at least one subnet in your network.

        {% endnote %}

    * `--private-dns-records-enabled`: (Optional) Parameter to create additional DNS [resource records](../../dns/concepts/resource-record.md) to override the public FQDN of the service to which the connection is created.

      {% include [private-endpoint-create-dns](private-endpoint-create-dns.md) %}

1. Make sure the service connection is created:

    ```bash
    yc vpc private-endpoint list
    ```
