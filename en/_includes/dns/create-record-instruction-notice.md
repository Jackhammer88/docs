{% note info %}

If your domain is delegated to {{ dns-full-name }}, create a resource record according to [this guide](../../dns/operations/resource-record-create.md). Otherwise, use your domain name registrar's personal account. If you have any questions, refer to the relevant documentation or contact the registrar's support service.
