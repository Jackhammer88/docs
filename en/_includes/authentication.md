# API authentication


Before you can work with the API, you need to get an [IAM token](../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md):

* [Guide](../iam/operations/iam-token/create.md) for Yandex accounts.
* [Guide](../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-sa.md) for service accounts.
* [Guide](../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-federation.md) for a federated or local account.

{% include [iam-token-usage](iam-token-usage.md) %}
