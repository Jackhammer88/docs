### No tables found {#no-tables}

Error message:

```text
Unable to find any tables
```

This error occurs when a source does not have any available tables or the specified user has no permissions for the schemas or tables.

**Solution**:

* Check the source for tables. Make sure you specified the correct source database and it actually has the tables you want to transfer.

* Check user permissions. For more information about the required permissions and assigning them, see [{#T}](../../../../data-transfer/operations/endpoint/source/mysql.md#prepare).
