### Operation canceled error {#operation-canceled}

The error occurs if a deactivation call interrupts the transfer activation before it is fully completed. This means the transfer did not have enough time to start fully.

**Solution**: Restart the transfer. 

A transfer may take several minutes to start: it needs this time to reserve and start the resources.
