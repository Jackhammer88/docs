**{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.clickhouse.console.form.clickhouse.ClickHouseTargetAdvancedSettings.retry_failed_toasts_in_batch_as_sequential_upserts.title }}**: Select this option for transfers from {{ ydb-name }} with the `UPDATES` [changefeed](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/cdc) mode and for `Increment Only` transfers that move events among the documents that are not in the {{ CH }} target. Use it only if you have to because inserting `UPSERT` sequentially can reduce performance.
