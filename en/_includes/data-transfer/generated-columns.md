If a database contains tables with generated columns, such tables will not be migrated and the transfer will end with an error. For more information, see [Troubleshooting](../../data-transfer/troubleshooting/index.md#generated-columns). To make sure the transfer is running properly when migrating a database with such tables, add them to the list of excluded tables in the [source endpoint settings](../../data-transfer/operations/endpoint/source/postgresql.md#additional-settings.md).
