You can only link one service account to a virtual machine.

{% endnote %}

To link a service account to a VM, you need a permission to use this account. This permission comes with the [iam.serviceAccounts.user](../iam/security/index.md#iam-serviceAccounts-user) and [editor](../iam/roles-reference.md#editor) roles or higher.
