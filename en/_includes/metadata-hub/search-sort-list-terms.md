You can use the management console to find terms by ID or name, sort terms by name, and customize the columns in the list.

To find a term, enter its ID or name in the search bar above the list of terms.

To sort terms by name, click the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.name }}** column header. This will sort the terms in alphabetical order. A second click on the same header reverses the sorting order. A third click cancels the sorting.
