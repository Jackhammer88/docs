Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with Network Level Authentication (NLA) is enabled for images of all versions and editions of the Windows operating system prepared for {{ yandex-cloud }}. Before connecting to a VM, make sure that NLA is enabled in your desktop settings.

You can connect to a VM with the `RUNNING` status over RDP. It may take some time for all services to initialize after the VM [starts](../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-stop-and-start.md#start). If you get a connection error, try again in a few minutes.

Virtual machine [security groups](../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) must allow incoming TCP traffic to port 3389.

To connect using RDP, specify the public IP address or the FQDN of the VM. You can use FQDN to access a VM from another {{ yandex-cloud }} VM if both are connected to the same network. To get the IP address and FQDN, use the management console: go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.overview.section_network }}** section on the VM page.

To connect to the VM:
